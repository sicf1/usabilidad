00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.880
The pancreas and diabetes.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.800
The pancreas is a small organ

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.400
approximately 15 cm long

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.920
located in the abdominal cavity

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.840
behind the stomach.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.360
This organ has two main functions:

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.480
The exocrine function and the endocrine function.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.840
In the exocrine function,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.400
the exocrine cells of the pancreas

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.040
produce enzymes that help digestion,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.160
while the endocrine function

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.080
is responsible for the production of

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.760
hormones or substances.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.440
The two main pancreatic hormones

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.600
are insulin and glucagon.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.120
Insulin serves to lower

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.640
the level of glucose in the blood,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.720
while glucagon increases it.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.840
Together these two main hormones

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.840
work to maintain the proper level

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.400
of glucose in the blood.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.160
In diabetes,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.640
the loss of correct endocrine function

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.480
occurs . What is diabetes?

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.800
Diabetes is a disease in which the level of

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.680
glucose in the blood is higher

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.600
than normal; it occurs when the pancreas

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.840
does not produce enough insulin or when

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.400
the body does not use insulin properly.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.800
Sometimes the person has both problems,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.000
in both cases the result is that

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.600
glucose does not enter the cells and

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.720
accumulates in the blood.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.480
Types of diabetes:

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.480
There are three types. Type 1, type

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.560
2 or diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.040
Causes.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.880
Type one: Type one diabetes occurs

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.920
primarily in children or adolescents,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.240
but can occur later in life.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.040
The exact causes are unknown

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.920
, but some factors are known, such as

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.080
autoimmunity in which the

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.160
immune system selectively attacks

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.280
insulin-producing cells.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.640
It can also be caused by a genetic factor

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.960
since the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.000
predisposition to have diabetes can be inherited,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.760
but not diabetes. itself,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.720
or also due to environmental damage.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.480
Type two: This is the most common type of diabetes.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.480
What happens is that the

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.360
body does not produce enough insulin and

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.080
becomes resistant to the action of insulin.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.520
Adult and elderly patients are presented

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.800
, many of them overweight.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.560
Younger people can also

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.720
develop type 2 diabetes.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.520
80% of people who

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.480
develop type 2 diabetes are

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.680
obese and do not have a very active life.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.280
The remaining 20% ​​often have an

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.000
inherited defect that causes

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.720
insulin resistance.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.320
Type 2 diabetes has

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.400
a higher hereditary risk

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.840
than type one.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.480
Gestational diabetes: it is a type of

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.320
diabetes that occurs only during pregnancy.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.560
It usually disappears when the baby is born.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.080
The mechanism is not well known

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.080
, but it appears that pregnancy hormones

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.440
alter the effect of insulin.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.240
However, women who have gestational diabetes

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.160
are more likely to have

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.120
type two diabetes later.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.600
Clinical picture: symptoms.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.080
Type 1. The general symptoms are:

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.840
thirst, increased urinary frequency (polyuria),

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.000
fatigue, blurred vision, excessive hunger,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.400
unexplained weight loss,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.520
stomach pain, nausea, vomiting,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.880
in some cases

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.400
numbness of the extremities may

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.120
occur, foot pain and recurrent or serious infections.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.760
Type 2: Symptoms may be similar to

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.920
type 1 diabetes, but are

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.360
often less severe.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.080
Patients sometimes have no

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.440
or minimal clinical manifestations

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.760
for several years before diagnosis.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.680
Gestational: intense thirst and increased

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.760
urinary frequency are often observed,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.880
although there may be other manifestations.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.400
It is characterized by the development of a

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.960
larger than normal fetus.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.000
Treatment.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.720
Treatment depends on the type of diabetes.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.320
Type 1: In type 1 diabetes you have

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.960
to take insulin injections

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.840
throughout your life.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.000
different combinations. The patient

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.840
should be educated about diet,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.000
exercise, and foot care since

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.920
diabetes can cause damage to the

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.680
nerves and blood vessels in the feet.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.880
Type two: in type two,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.360
patients must be treated with diet and

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.400
exercise alone or by adding an

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.800
oral antidiabetic medication, with a combination

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.560
of oral medications and insulin or with

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.400
insulin alone.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.000
Gestational: pregnant patients

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.960
should have

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.960
strict metabolic control of blood glucose

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.200
to reduce obstetric risks.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.280
They are treated through diet and exercise

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.640
to which

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.400
oral antidiabetics or insulin

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.480
are sometimes added

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.720
. In all cases, a glucometer

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.240
must be provided to monitor blood glucose.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.600
And that's all for this video.
